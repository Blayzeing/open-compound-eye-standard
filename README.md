# OCES: The Open Compound Eye Standard
An open extension of the glTF standard to define and describe apposition compound eyes in 3D space.

This standard is still currently in draft as we await feedback from potential users and prepare the release of a publication. However, the standard is functional as a glTF extension via use of the JSON schema present in the **schema/** folder.

The **specification-documents/** folder contains the most up-to-date version of the specification document.
This document outlines the conceptual implementation of the schema as well as the specific JSON Schema primitives specified in the extension.
In the future, it will also contain sample eyes and reference implementation code.
